All files here generate outputs for/regarding the LSFF model. Inputs either stored in data_prep/inputs/ or /snfs1/Project/.



# Map scales ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each choropleth map visualizing variable X, we chose to map X to colors along either a 
linear and log scale, and to either topcode above some threshold or not, depending on the
distribution of X.

In general, for each type of data being visualized and for each scale it is plotted with, there
is a different notebook to generate corresponding plots.

# LSFF DALYs attributable maps ---------------------------------------------------------------

These were outputted for the following causes/risks:
- ntds
- iron deficiency (or total iron responsive anemia)
- vitamin a deficiency (vad)
- zinc deficiency

for the metrics:
- absolute DALYs (count)
- DALYs per 100_000pys (rate)

for the populations:
- under 5 (u5)
- women of reproductive age (wra), for total iron

These were generated by one of the following scripts, depending on the data distribution:
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map_topcoded
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map_logspace

Here we include the script -> output assignment:
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map
    - DALY rate, Iron, WRA
    - DALY rate, Iron, u5
    - DALY rate, zinc, u5
    - DALY count, vad, u5
    - DALY rate, NTDs, u5
    
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map_topcoded
    - DALY count, iron, WRA
    - DALY count, iron, u5
    - DALY rate, vad, u5
    
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_dalys_attributable_map_logspace
    - DALY count, zinc, u5
    - DALY count, NTDs, u5
    
    
# GBD Models: input data density maps ----------------------------------------------------------

'Data density' here refers to number of rows of input for a given country.
(As opposed to number of sources, aggregate sample sizes across studies and surveys, etc.)
ALL MAPS HERE WERE PLOTTED IN LOG SPACE.

These were outputted for:
- zinc deficiency (risk)
- vit a deficiency (risk)
- iron deficiency (risk)
- vit a deficiency (cause)
- iron deficiency (cause)
- neural tube defects (cause)

Script -> output assignment:
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_GBD_risks_and_causes_model_input_data_density_maps
    - zinc deficiency (risk)
    - vit a deficiency (risk)
    - iron deficiency (risk)
    - vit a deficiency (cause)
    - iron deficiency (cause)
- 2021_01_15_LSFF_GBD_risks_and_causes_model_input_data_density_maps_topcoding
    - neural tube defects (cause)
        - Plotted in logspace
        - Topcoded China "to the value "above 100,000 rows of data", because the
        input file for China's data was too large to download by our deadline.
