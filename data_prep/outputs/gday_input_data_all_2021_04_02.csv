These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program. Some of these values have questionable accuracy and care should be taken in their application if not corroborated by other data.",paulina,12/11/2020,Yes,,

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program. Some of these values have questionable accuracy and care should be taken in their application if not corroborated by other data.",rohit,12/2/2020,Yes,,

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program. Some of these values have questionable accuracy and care should be taken in their application if not corroborated by other data.",paulina,12/11/2020,Yes,,

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program.

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple. One should be cautious in using the maize data since some of the supply may go to non-food uses, such as brewing. These figures can be used as an initial guide to identify cereal fortification opportunities, to help calculate the amount of micronutrients to add to achieve a desired public health impact, and to estimate the impact of an existing fortification program. Some of these values have questionable accuracy and care should be taken in their application if not corroborated by other data.",paulina,12/11/2020,Yes,,

These estimates were made by taking 75%, a standard extraction rate, of the 1997-2000 average of wheat and maize consumption from the FAO food balance sheets, except for Latin American countries where the figures were provided by the milling industry. The maize consumption is given only for selected countries where maize is an important food staple.
